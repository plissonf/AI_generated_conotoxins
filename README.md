# AI_generated_conotoxins
This repository contains algorithms to generate artificial conotoxins.  The algorithms were created by Jesus Gabriel Osuna Osuna, under the supervision of Emmanuel Ricardo Lagunas Ocampo and Dr. Fabien Plisson, as part of his BSc thesis to obtain the degree "Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Biotecnologia" from the "Universidad Politecnica de Sinaloa" in 2020. The title of his thesis is "Generacion de Nuevas Conotoxins utilizando Algoritmos de Inteligencia Artificial".

DATA
Sequences and multiple sequence alignment of 346 alpha-conotoxins (Cysteine Framework I).

SCRIPTS
This section contains algorithms 
- 1) functions to analyze the conotoxins sequences, 
- 2) functions to generate new artificial sequences,
- 3) machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the natural character of the artificially generated sequences
